## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-langraph-project.git
cd my-langraph-project
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will execute the `app.ts` file, which initializes the application and integrates the Langraph functionality.

## API

### Langraph Class

The `Langraph` class provides methods for managing graphs:

- `addNode(node: Node)`: Adds a new node to the graph.
- `addEdge(edge: Edge)`: Adds a new edge between two nodes.
- `renderGraph()`: Renders the graph visually.

### Node and Edge Interfaces

The project defines the following interfaces:

- `Node`: Represents a node in the graph with properties such as `id` and `label`.
- `Edge`: Represents an edge connecting two nodes with properties such as `from` and `to`.
